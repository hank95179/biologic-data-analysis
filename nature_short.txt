Backbone of RNA viruses uncovered

The evolutionary history of viruses is largely unknown. Large-scale discovery of
vertebrate RNA viruses shows that, although viruses often jump between hosts,
most have co-evolved with their hosts over millions of years.

Many human diseases, from the common cold to deadly haemorrhagic fevers, are
caused by RNA viruses. Most of these viruses are thought to have originated from
close relatives that infected mammals, and so the majority of virus-discovery
studies have focused on mammals and birds. RNA viruses, however, are probably
older than the last common ancestor oflife on Earthãƒ» Detailed genetic
information for RNA viruses from other classes of vertebrate is sorely needed if
we are to fully understand long-term virus evolution. In a paper in Nature, Shi et
al. report the discovery of previously unidentified vertebrate RNA viruses from
across evolutionary timescales.
